            <p id="totetext">The other day, I found myself staring at people’s tote bags. Different colors, shapes, and materials hang from everyone’s shoulder, but what do they tell? Do they provoke ideas or make a statement? Who wears it? My best friend? My boyfriend? A random stranger on the train? All of these ideas lingered in my thoughts so I decided to create an archive of tote bags and the cool words they hold.</p>
            <p id="totetext">By the time I arrived at Washington Square Park from Morgan Library & Museum, I took out my phone and created the account. I was wearing a tote bag that my friends gave me on my birthday. Taking picture of it, I wrote “On my way back from lunch, I thought that I should go explore tote bags in the city. So I am starting this journey to find more tote bags and cool words to share with people. Hope I started something cool.” Looking back to it, it was definitely and proudly something cool!</p>

            <p id="sockstext">The other day, my friend Aristotle got inspired by my tote bag archive. But he wanted to archive socks. Different colors, sizes, and lengths wrap everyone’s feet, but what do they tell? Do they read poems or retell stories? Who wears it? My friend’s roommate? My roommate’s friend? A random stranger on the train? All of these ideas made Aristotle curious so he decided to archive everyone’s sock and cool words wrapping around it.</p>
            <p id="sockstext"> While he was standing in front of the MET museum, he took out his phone and created an account. Our friend Qashka was wearing red socks and blue pants. She did not tell big stories, she just said “lepentine.” Until this day, no one knows if lepentine is a real word. But, in fact, Qashka said that it is not a real word.</p>

            <p>This website is a little summary of an archive we collected. Some people talk about their reality through their tote bags and socks, while some people love to get crazy and just say made-up words. I am truly hoping this place will be an explosion of personal creativity and voices. What else could be pushed further like tote bags and socks? Pants? Jackets? Phone Cases? Sweaters? Bowls? Phone? Wallet? Keys? Sunglasses? Watch? Backpack? Headphones? Laptop? Water bottle? Jewelry? Camera? Umbrella? Notebook? Pen?</p>
